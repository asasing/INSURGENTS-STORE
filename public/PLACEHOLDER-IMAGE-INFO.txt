PLACEHOLDER IMAGE NEEDED
========================

You need to add a placeholder image for products without images.

Required file: placeholder-product.jpg
Location: public/placeholder-product.jpg
Recommended size: 800x800 pixels (square)

You can:
1. Create a simple gray square with text "No Image"
2. Use an online placeholder generator like:
   - https://placeholder.com/
   - https://via.placeholder.com/800x800.png?text=Product+Image
3. Download and rename any placeholder image

For now, the app will show a gray box if this file is missing.
